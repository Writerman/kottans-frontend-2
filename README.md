## 0. Git Basics 
  Completing the task, I've learned basics of Git. Since this tool is new for me, I was really surprised by incredible important possibilities of version control.   
  Now, using command line, I can initialize repositories, add files on staging index, make commits, point tags; create branches, developing safely and isolated, merge branches together; undo or modify changes that have been saved to the repo.
